        <P>Over the past week, European thermal coal indices surged to 127 USD/t. Quotes were supported by a reduction in stockpiles and an increase in German consumption. <br>
            An additional driver remains the growth of energy markets, including gas and electricity prices, amid geopolitical tensions in the Middle East and possible damage to gas measuring station near the border town of Sudzha (the Kursk region) because of a Ukrainian attack, which could lead to disruptions in gas transit via Ukraine to the EU.

            Gas quotations at TTF hub strengthened to 442.26 USD/1,000 m3 (+5.99 USD/1,000 m3 w-o-w). Coal stocks at ARA terminals decreased to 5.12 mio t (-0.21 mio t or -4% w-o-w).
            
            South African High-CV 6,000 was holding at 115-116 USD/t. A positive factor is the growing trend in the European market and steady demand from India, where local coal stocks at power plants declined by 4% over the past week, due to increased generation and lower shipments from Coal India. Nevertheless, in view of falling steel prices, buying activity by sponge iron producers has declined.
            
            Monthly throughput at Richards Bay Coal Terminal (RBCT) is expected to recover to 4.2 mio t in August and to 4.0 mio t in September.
            
            For January-September, transshipment is forecasted at 36.2 mio t (-0.2 mio t vs. January-September 2023). Glencore Coal’s CEO anticipates the terminal’s throughput to total 50-52 mio t by the end of 2024. On Monday, rail operator Transnet announced that owing to maintenance, the speed limit (28 km) on the rail line to RBCT was lifted.
            
            In China, spot prices for 5,500 NAR coal at the port of Qinhuangdao slipped to 119 USD/t on deteriorating demand, related to the expected easing of heat wave as two weeks are left for the end of summer.
            
            Moreover, some minor producers lowered prices to attract buyers, though this had little effect. Market participants are also concerned the production may rise before the end of August, given the forecasted minimum level of rainfall in the northern coal mining provinces. However, prices may be supported by a reduction in Daqin coal shipping volumes, which amounted to 0.95 mio t/day vs. 1.05 mio t/day a week earlier.
            
            China’s coal extraction in July fell to 390.37 mio t. (-15 mio t vs. June 2024). January-July production amounted to 2.66 billion t (-0.8% to Jan-July 2023). <br>
